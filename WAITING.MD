# AIeremin - Current Status & Next Steps (While Waiting for DNS)

## Current Status (April 29, 2025)

*   **Core Application:** MVP functionality (multi-finger tracking, sound generation, UI) is complete and working locally.
*   **Build Process:** Production build process (`npm run build:prod`) is configured using esbuild and outputs to the `public/` directory.
*   **Backend Setup:**
    *   Token Store (Supabase) is configured with an `access_tokens` table.
    *   Serverless functions (`handle-purchase`, `validate-token`) are created in `netlify/functions/`.
    *   Frontend (`script.ts`) updated to perform token validation on load.
*   **Deployment Configuration:**
    *   Project pushed to GitHub (`https://github.com/IreGaddr/AIeremin`).
    *   Netlify site created and linked to the GitHub repository.
    *   `netlify.toml` configured for build and functions deployment.
    *   Supabase environment variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`) added securely to Netlify build settings.
*   **Current Blocker:** Waiting for DNS propagation for the live domain (e.g., `aieremin.com` or the assigned `.netlify.app` URL) to fully resolve. This is required to configure the Gumroad webhook correctly.

## Next Steps (Once DNS is Ready)

1.  **Configure Gumroad Webhook:**
    *   **Action:** In Gumroad Settings > Advanced > Pings, add the Netlify function URL: `https://<your-live-url>/.netlify/functions/handle-purchase`.
    *   **Note:** Replace `<your-live-url>` with the actual deployed domain.
    *   **(Optional):** Configure webhook secret/signature verification for enhanced security.

2.  **End-to-End Testing (Deployment Plan Step 7):**
    *   **Action:** Perform a Gumroad test purchase.
    *   **Verify:**
        *   `handle-purchase` function runs successfully (check Netlify logs).
        *   A new token is created in the Supabase `access_tokens` table.
        *   Accessing the app with the **valid unique token link** works correctly (check `validate-token` logs & app behavior).
        *   Accessing the app with an **invalid/missing token** correctly blocks access and shows an error.

3.  **(Optional) Implement Email Delivery:**
    *   **Action:** Integrate an email service (e.g., Resend, SendGrid) into the `handle-purchase` function to automatically email the unique access link to customers.
    *   **Note:** Requires signing up for the email service and adding its API key as another environment variable in Netlify.

4.  **(Optional) Implement Gumroad Webhook Verification:**
    *   **Action:** Add signature verification logic to the start of the `handle-purchase` function using the `GUMROAD_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable.

5.  **UI/UX Polish (Post-MVP):**
    *   Improve dot/line styling.
    *   Add volume indication visuals.
    *   Add a color legend for fingers.
    *   Refine button/status styles.
    *   Add basic usage instructions.

6.  **PWA Features (Optional):**
    *   Add `manifest.json` and a basic service worker to allow "Add to Home Screen" functionality.
